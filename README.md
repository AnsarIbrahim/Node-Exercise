# Node-Exercise: Understanding Callback Hell, Async and Promises in Node.js

This repository is dedicated to exercises that help understand the concepts of Callback Hell, Async functions, and Promises in Node.js.

## Callback Hell

"Callback Hell" is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other.

## Async Functions

Async functions are a combination of promises and generators to reduce the boilerplate around promises, and the "don't break the chain" limitation of chaining promises.

## Promises

Promises are a pattern that helps with one particular kind of asynchronous programming: a function that returns a single result asynchronously.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnsarIbrahim/Node-Exercise.git
cd Node-Exercise
